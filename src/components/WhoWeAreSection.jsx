            Who We Are
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Future Earth was founded in 2018 by a team of people driven by a
            passion to break the poverty cycle in the developing world and
            empower people with self-sustaining wealth creation avenues that
            improve standards of living now and for future generations.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            From decades of experience working on sustainable forestry projects
            around the world, our founders Jason Rosamond and Maya Minkova come
            with a wealth of knowledge. They have a long-held ambition to use
            timber as one of the earthâ€™s own natural resources, to help
            alleviate housing poverty in rural Africa.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            We use a blueprint based on PATHWAY (power, agriculture, technology,
            housing, women and youth), a model that was designed by one of our
            founders, Maya Minkova for a sustainable homes project in South
            African townships 25 years ago.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Our team is rich in expertise, with combined backgrounds in
            forestry, finance, emerging markets, infrastructure development, and
            agriculture, and a common goal to help create better lives for
            people in need.

            Future Earthâ€™s blueprint is based on a model that was designed by
            one of our founders, Maya Minkova, 25 years ago while still a
            student, for a safe and sustainable homes project in South African
            townships. We have adapted the PATHWAY (power, agriculture,
            technology, housing, women and youth) model as the framework that
            outlines our projects.

          <p className="text-lg font-extralight mb-8 lg:max-w-xl">
            We believe that women and the youth, who make up more than half of
            the society, are critical in unlocking self-development. The project
            will target women as homeowners, giving them assets and credit and
            therefore power to self-develop. We also emphasize support for SMEs
            owned by women and young people to provide services within the
            community.

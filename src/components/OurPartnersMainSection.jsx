            Instead of implementing a single component of a solution across
            multiple communities, as has been done in the past, we focus on
            delivering an integrated economic system to a community to help lift
            it to a sustainable minimum standard of living from which it can
            grow and progress independently. We have therefore identified and
            made collaborative efforts with organizations that share our vision
            and help steer it forward.

                  Because water access is a common issue faced in the areas we

                  home sanitation solutions meeting WHO health guidelines.
